Monty-Hall
==========

An experiment to test to the Monty Hall problem using a simulation.

Written using a TDD OOP approach.

(Note: I frequently committed during the red/green/refactor cycle - but I can't for the life of me get converting an hg repo into git working. So if you are interested in seeing the commit history go over to the original project hosted here: <https://bitbucket.org/nickmeldrum/monty-hall>.
